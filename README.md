# LoRaSX128X
SX128X Driver that works on ESP IDF.

I had a lots of difficulties using the drivers offered online for chip SX128X for ESP IDF, so as part of a larger project, I had to reprogram my own.

Feel free to use it. Sorry if it mostly has the functions I needed, but once you see how I got it to work, you should be able to program methods as you need them.
